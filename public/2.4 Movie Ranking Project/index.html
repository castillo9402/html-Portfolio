 <h1>Bad Boys movies Ranked</h1>
 <h2>From best to worst in my personal opinion</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>#1- Bad Boys 3</h3>
 <p>I walked in to the cinemas ready and prepared to watch and expect it to be another bad remake of a movie, and walked out satisfied with what I just watched. This movie was spot on with the environment and the comedy back to its old days. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something with tons of comedy, and tons of action at the same time.</p>
 <h3> #2- Bad Boys 4</h3>
 <p>Ride or Die is phenomenal. I love the Bad Boys franchise. This one raised every bar. It’s nonstop hilarious. Innovative action beats. So much chemistry with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. 
The best time I’ve had at the movies in a while. Absolutely loved it.</p>
    <h3>#3 Bad Boys 2</h3>
    <p>Remember watching this at 8 years old without my mom knowing and my dad pretending as he did not know... yea thats how good this movie was</p>
